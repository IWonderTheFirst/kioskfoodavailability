# Kiosk Food Availability Application
 Code by Riku Ishihara, Data Creation & Management by Kaito Nonaka

 ## Application usage
The application consists of two inputs: The product name and the stock. Using these two pieces of infromation, the application will create a graph estimating the stock of the product for a time. In the future, a feature will be implemented that will make the kisok products selectable.

 ## How to use
This application can only run with the 1 million transaction data. To use this, have this python script in the same directory as the 1 million transaction data, renamed as "data.csv".

Because the transaction data surpased the data limit of github upload, I couldn't upload the data here.

## Purpose
Me and Kaito believed that in the Kiosk, products such as the BLT and Onigiri weren't avaiablle at certain periods. To allow students and faculty to buy products before it runs out of stock, we develoopted this applications that allows the user to determine the perfect timing to buy their desired product.
